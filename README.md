ImageEdit
=========

The program opens by default to a picture of Kethan Mayer-Patel, associate professor at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. 

There are three tools available from a drop down box:

The Pixel Inspector tool will report the following information of a clicked pixel of a loaded picture:

1. The (x, y) coordinate of the pixel
2. The RGB of the pixel--reported as a value between 0.00 and 1.00. By definition R+G+B must = 1.00

The Paint Brush tool allows one to draw over top of the loaded image in a similar fashion to MS Paint.
The three sliders provided adjust the RGB of the color of paint--a preview of which is a available in the upper right.
The Brush Size bar defines the size of the brush across in pixels. 

The Blur Brush tool takes the size of the brush in pixels and sets the value of every pixel in the brush area 
equal to the square of pixels surrounding it with radius equal to the blur area bar. 

The open button pulls a picture url from the text field adjacent it and opens that picture for editing. 


Currently in progress features include an undo button.
